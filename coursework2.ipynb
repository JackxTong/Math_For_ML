    "In 1(a), the loss converges quite slowly, taking around 500 epochs to converge and reach a loss level below 0.2, suggesting the learning rate should be set higher. Another choice would be to use SGD with momentum, since the error decay is smooth, momentum can speed up the convergence, or incorporate curvature information, like using inverse hessian as a dynamic learning rate (newton's method)\n",
    "\n",
    "In (b), the learing rate was set too high. The loss quickly drops to around 0.2 in 10 epochs or so, but quickly oscillates between (0.2, 0.6) for the next 500 epochs with no sign of convergence. We can try reduce the learning rate, or use adaptive optimizers like Adam\n",
    "\n",
    "In (c), the learning rate is just right. The convergence is fast, loss decays to around 0.1 within 50 epochs, with some minor oscillations. This looks like the learning rate is already fine-tuned, although we can do further hyparameter tuning if we have the time (try increase /decrease learning rate by 10% and see what happens, try different seeds to see if this improves further, or stay as good, or perhaps we are just lucky on this one)"

    "Adversarial attacks are a big challenge when deploying machine learning in security-critical fields. A few real-world examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Facial Recognition & Authentication: Attackers can subtly modify an image to fool face recognition or fingerprint scanners, especially when people are using face ID to make payments (like alipay in China). Attackers may use adversarial attacks to fool the clasifier and make false payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Self-Driving Cars: An autonomous vehicle may misread road situations when there is small distortion, leading to dangerous decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples include the use of AI experts in hospitals, clinical research etc, and in finance, where criminals may want to fool the fraud detection models. \n",
    "\n",
    "How Can We Defend Against These Attacks?  \n",
    "We want to teach the model to recognize adversarial examples by including them in training, helping it learn more robust patterns. We can also use ensemble Models: Use multiple models instead of just one—this makes it harder for attackers to fool the system since different models won’t be tricked in the same way. The idea of ensemble models, eg. random forests, is to use independent models trained on different subset of features and different subsets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally your models independently understand different aspects of data, so that the ensemble is less prone to overfitting and generalizes better. When you have an attack rate of $p$, this scales down to $O(p^n)$ with $n$ being the number of models in your ensemble"
